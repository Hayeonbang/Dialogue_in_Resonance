            <b>Overall Experience</b>
            <div class="question">Q: Can you describe your overall experience performing <em>Dialogue in Resonance</em>?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> Performing this work was a highly memorable experience. 
                    Despite the challenge of collaborating with an AI pianist, it genuinely felt like playing with a real human partner. 
                    As in traditional two-piano settings, the process of listening and reacting to each other was naturally realized here. 
                    I was especially impressed by how the system reflected the musical material I played—sometimes reproducing it exactly, 
                    sometimes transforming it into an accompaniment, prompting me to improvise new melodic ideas over it. Also, the dynamic and timbral integration between my piano and the system was so coherent that at times it felt even smoother than playing with another person. </div>
                    The structural design of the piece greatly supported this interaction.<br>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span>  What made the experience especially meaningful was that the team I had worked with—originally in a research context—stepped outside the typical framework of a technical showcase and engaged in artistic expression for the first time. At first, there was hesitation, but once the performance began, everyone truly enjoyed it, empathized with each other’s roles, and offered mutual artistic encouragement. That transformation was deeply moving and rewarding to witness.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: How was this experience different from traditional two-piano performance or contemporary music in general?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> The interaction closely resembled performing with a real pianist. Just like in a standard duet, one performer initiates and the other responds. Interestingly, unlike human duos that may experience interpretive inconsistencies, this system offered more seamless integration and responsiveness.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> I’ve previously encountered contemporary works that manipulate sound in real time using live recordings—transforming audio or generating ambient textures from it. What stood out to me about this piece was how those ideas were extended and reinterpreted through the use of an acoustic piano, a Disklavier (automated piano), and real-time transcription. The fact that such concepts were realized not through electronic sound sources, but through the piano as a central medium, made the experience feel particularly fresh and compelling.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: Did the interactive nature of the system affect your approach to performance?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> Definitely. Like any two-piano performance, I had to listen carefully to the phrasing and timing of the other part and adjust mine accordingly. When the system played something more expressive or virtuosic, I naturally lowered my tension or adapted my flow to match its direction.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> This piece places a strong emphasis on timing-based interaction, which significantly shaped my approach to performance. When I played a phrase, the second piano would follow after a short delay, or respond with a transformed version in a canon-like manner, reminiscent of Baroque structures. As a result, I had to continuously listen to and anticipate the second piano’s responses and shape my playing accordingly.
                    This required me to actively adjust tempo, phrasing, and articulation in real time, not merely to follow the score but to build the music collaboratively with the system. I felt that this ongoing process of temporal negotiation created an evolving musical form—one that added layers and variations beyond what was fixed in notation.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: How aware were you of the system’s responses, and how did this affect your immersion?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> I was constantly aware of the system’s responses. That awareness did not distract me—it enriched my playing. The interaction influenced my phrasing, and the system's responses sometimes even changed how I expressed certain passages. For a trained pianist, such mutual awareness is natural, and I was able to immerse myself deeply without difficulty.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> I was constantly aware of the second piano’s responses. The structure of the piece felt like a real-time musical dialogue, where listening to the system and reacting to it was essential. It was not just about reacting to preprogrammed cues—it was about hearing the system’s output and shaping my next phrase based on what I heard.
                    For example, depending on when and how the second piano entered, I would adjust how I proceeded with the next phrase. This real-time awareness had a direct impact on the pacing and flow of the performance, making each moment dependent on mutual listening and response.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: Did those real-time responses influence your emotional engagement?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> Absolutely. The interactive nature of the piece directly affected my emotions. The system’s reactions shaped my interpretation in real time, making the experience deeply immersive.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span>  In a solo performance, there is always a certain pressure to fill the entire space with your own sound. In contrast, during this piece, I experienced my own musical phrases returning in transformed or distorted forms through the second piano. This gave me a strong sense that I was not filling the space alone—there was another presence contributing to the soundscape. It created a richer sensory immersion and a heightened awareness of real-time interaction, as if I were co-constructing the sonic environment with an invisible partner.
                    Compared to traditional two-piano performances, which are typically based on some degree of mutual planning or agreed-upon improvisation, this piece allowed me to take the lead entirely, with the second piano responding in real time. That structure gave me a stronger sense of autonomy as a performer. Within that autonomy, I was constantly receiving and reacting to live musical feedback, which made the experience both uniquely immersive and dynamically responsive.</div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <b>Real-Time Transcription and Performance Challenges</b>

            <div class="question">Q: What was the most difficult part of performing with the real-time transcription system?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> During rehearsals, the latency in the system’s response made synchronization somewhat difficult. However, because the piece employs a modern, non-tonal idiom, such temporal flexibility felt musically acceptable—and even expressive.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> The most challenging aspect was the unpredictability of the system. While the second piano generally responds according to the notated material, in practice, unexpected variations often occur—such as subtle delays, added breaths, or shifts in emphasis. These deviations required me to remain constantly alert, monitoring the system’s behavior and adjusting my performance accordingly. That sense of uncertainty created a persistent tension, as I had to stay fully engaged with the second piano’s real-time responses throughout the performance.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: What kind of preparation was needed to understand the system’s behavior?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> It required a continuous process of exploration. I experimented with different dynamics, rhythms, and articulations to understand how the system would react. This exploratory approach was essential.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> It took time to explore how the system responded to my playing through repeated rehearsals. It wasn’t just about learning fixed behaviors—it was about understanding the algorithm’s character: how it receives sound and how it returns it. That exploratory process was essential in gradually learning to interpret and guide the system’s responses in a musically meaningful way.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: Did the system’s response ever interfere with or confuse your performance?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> Occasionally, there may have been glitches, but they were not easy to distinguish. I often interpreted those unexpected behaviors as aleatoric elements within the piece rather than disruptions.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> Yes, especially when the system began responding with a tempo, character, or nuance that significantly diverged from what I had initially established. As a performer, I have a certain expressive direction in mind, and when the response strays too far from that, it can feel disruptive. However, through rehearsals, we were able to identify those moments and adjust accordingly to find a more stable and coherent flow.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: Were there moments when you had to adjust your interpretation based on the system's response?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span>  Yes. There were times when the system reacted differently from what I anticipated. In such cases, I modified my interpretation to maintain musical continuity.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <b>Sense of Connection and Co-Creation</b>
    
            <div class="question">Q: Did the system feel more like a co-performer or co-creator rather than just a tool?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span>Absolutely. From the start, it felt like I was playing with another pianist. In some ways, it even felt like another version of myself—a musical mirror that listened and responded thoughtfully. </div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span>Absolutely. The system didn’t feel like a passive tool merely reproducing sound—it actively filled the space with me and inspired artistic ideas alongside my own. I felt that we were shaping the music together, with the system taking on a significant role in carrying the performance forward. It gave me a genuine sense of musical partnership, as if we were part of a shared creative community. </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">Q: Did you feel emotionally connected to the system’s responses? Were there moments of disconnection?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> I definitely felt a strong connection. The basic mechanism—where the system listens to my playing and responds—creates a natural sense of dialogue. For example, when the system echoed my phrase and I layered a new melody on top, it felt like a true musical conversation. I didn’t experience any real sense of disconnection.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> </div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: Did the presence of the operator affect your performance?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span>I didn’t feel alone on stage, which was somewhat reassuring, but my full concentration was on the sonic interaction with the second piano. I wasn’t consciously aware of the operator’s presence during the performance. </div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> I wasn’t particularly aware of the operator during the performance. My focus was entirely on the sound and behavior of the second piano. Still, the awareness that I wasn’t completely alone on stage provided a subtle but comforting sense of support. </div>
            </div>
        </div>        



        <div class="subsection">
            <b>Reflections and Suggestions</b>
            <div class="question">Q: What improvements would you like to see in future versions of the system? </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> I hope for more nuanced timbral expression. If the system could more precisely reflect subtle articulations and tone color, it would deepen the sense of musical agency and interaction.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> It would be interesting if the pianist could have more agency in choosing the types of system responses. For example, if a wider range of feedback options were available—and the performer could select or influence them—it would enrich the interaction and allow for greater artistic individuality. I believe it would open up new expressive possibilities for both performance and composition. </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="question">Q: What was the most memorable and the most frustrating part of the experience?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> The most memorable part was the sense of genuine dialogue with an intelligent and responsive partner. In fact, it felt more meaningful than some collaborations I’ve had with human pianists. The system’s dynamic control and velocity responsiveness contributed greatly to its realism. The only frustration was the limited range of timbral expression—but overall, it was a profoundly engaging and rewarding experience.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> The most memorable aspect was the feeling of performing with a kind of shadow or alter ego. Although the responses were somewhat predetermined, I was initiating the musical flow, and the system responded accordingly. That interaction created a deep sense of connection and immersion.</div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <b>Initial Engagement and Familiarization</b>
    
            <div class="question">Q: How long did it take for you to become comfortable with the system after first encountering it?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span>The actual rehearsal period lasted about one week. Initially, my focus was primarily on technical control, but as I became more familiar with the system, I gradually began to perceive my role as a musical participant as well. </div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span>Although it was difficult at first, after about three to four practice sessions, I became comfortable.</div>
            </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <b>Real-Time Operation Experience</b>
    
            <div class="question">Q: What was the most important consideration when operating the system live?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span>In its current form, Max patches separate volume, pedal, and other controls into individual components, requiring multiple simultaneous operations during certain musical passages. Ensuring that none of these were missed was the most critical task. </div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span>I constantly worried about making sure the sustain pedal was triggered correctly and whether the feedback feature was properly turned on or not.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="question">Q: Were there any sections that were particularly difficult to operate</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span>Most sections were challenging. Passages with increasing intensity or layered textures were relatively manageable, but those requiring subtle dynamic shifts were much more demanding. The dynamic level of the second piano is entirely operator-dependent, so I had to consider the live acoustics and the first pianist’s interpretation. Because the output can vary by venue, repeated rehearsals were essential.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span>Yes, especially when transitioning from the third to the fourth section. In the earlier sections, I only had to manipulate one element at a time, but in the fourth section, I needed to balance two parameters simultaneously, which made it more difficult.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <b>Suggestions for System Improvement</b>
        
                <div class="question">Q: What improvements would you like to see in future versions of the system?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 1:</span> The Max patch should be reorganized for better usability. Functions like toggling feedback and initiating recordings are too fragmented. The score also includes difficult notations, such as septuplets, which make intuitive real-time navigation difficult without full memorization. More intuitive notation and detailed annotations would help improve performance.</div>
                    <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Pianist 2:</span> As more buttons are added, it feels like each function is exposed in a scattered manner. It would be better if some functions were integrated and operated sequentially. Also, having a clearly documented checklist of responsibilities would greatly improve usability.</div>
                </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <b>Expression and Musical Autonomy</b>
                <div class="question">Q: How much musical autonomy did you feel you had in controlling the second piano’s expressiveness?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 1:</span> Rather than making musical decisions directly, I focused on operating the second piano in accordance with the first piano’s phrasing. While the musical direction was led by the performer, parameters like timing and dynamics were still under my discretion, giving me a sense of autonomy.</div>
                    <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 2:</span> I felt that I had substantial control—being able to decide whether the second piano would sound or not, and controlling the volume and delay. However, I also believed that I was not doing it alone; the second piano's sound was shaped collaboratively by both the performer and operator.</div>
                </div>
            
                <div class="question">Q: Did you feel like you were “performing musically” or more like a technical operator?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 1:</span> Initially, I felt like a technical operator, but as I became more familiar with the system, I began to feel like a musical participant.</div>
                    <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 2:</span> I felt much more like a system operator. It was closer to an audio technician role—controlling actual sound output—rather than musical performance.</div>
                </div>
                </div>
                
            <div class="subsection">
            <b>Communication with the Pianist</b>
            <div class="question">Q: How important was communication with the pianist, and how well was it achieved?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 1:</span> Extremely important. The pianist must fully understand the piece, and mutual agreement on interpretation with the operator is essential. Due to time constraints in this performance, some timing discrepancies occurred. Furthermore, because I was operating from backstage without visual contact, prior coordination was even more critical.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 2:</span> Incredibly important. The sound of the second piano is co-created by the first pianist and the operator, so mutual understanding and agreement were essential.</div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="question">Q: Can you describe a moment when you had to immediately react or anticipate the performer’s actions?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 1:</span> Yes. In measure 29, the pianist held a fermata longer than expected, but I had already triggered recording based on our assumption of a shorter hold. This resulted in silence before playback started. Fortunately, the pianist noticed this and repeated the phrase, allowing the interaction to recover naturally.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 2:</span> There were moments where the pianist adapted to our mistakes rather than us reacting to them. For example, if the feedback did not play correctly due to an error on our end, the pianist would repeat the same measure or refrain from progressing to the next section, essentially compensating through musical gestures.</div>
            </div>
            </div>
                
            <div class="subsection">
            <b>Reflections and Suggestions</b>
            <div class="question">Q: Do you have any recommendations regarding manuals or training materials for operators?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 1:</span> Documenting the Max patch usage is essential for reusability. We annotated the score and reviewed past recordings, but many real-time decisions differed from what was notated. For instance, gradual pedal releases and missing dynamic markings had to be interpreted on the spot. It would be helpful if operational timing and dynamic cues were more explicitly written into the score.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 2:</span> Even if the basic setup is complete, it’s often necessary to modify elements within Max during operation. A deeper understanding of Max is crucial. For example, during the Disklavier setup, not being familiar with port selections and configurations delayed the process. A more intuitive and efficient setup process would be helpful.</div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="question">Q: What was the most interesting and the most challenging aspect of operating the system?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 1:</span> The integration of transcription as a musical element was particularly engaging. The structure of the piece accommodated small imperfections gracefully. The main challenge was the complexity of real-time operation, which always left room for minor errors.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 2:</span> I found the piece fascinating in the way it blends intentional and unintentional behaviors, challenging the idea that "sound once gone does not return"—a concept deeply rooted in both music and physics. Moreover, performing without seeing the pianist, yet having to interact musically, was a unique and challenging experience.</div>
            </div>
        
            <div class="question">Q: If you had another opportunity to operate this piece, what would you do differently?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 1:</span> I would coordinate more thoroughly with the pianist in advance. With more rehearsal time and shared interpretation, the result could be even more musically cohesive and reliable.</div>
                <div class="speaker"><span class="label">Operator 2:</span> I’d like to explore using more of Max’s advanced features to create more complex and layered feedback responses. That could lead to even more interesting musical outcomes.</div>
