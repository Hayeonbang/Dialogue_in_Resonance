            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>This paper presents <em>Dialogue in Resonance</em>, an interactive music piece for a human pianist and a computer-controlled piano that integrates real-time automatic music transcription into a score-driven framework. Unlike previous approaches that primarily focus on improvisation-based interactions, our work establishes a balanced framework that combines composed structure and dynamic interaction. Through real-time automatic transcription as its core mechanism, the computer interprets and responds to the human performer's input in real time, creating a musical dialogue that balances compositional intent with live interaction including unpredictability.</p>

            <h3>System Overview</h3>
            <p>The system architecture consists of two main components: a Python-based online AMT (Automatic Music Transcription) model that processes the audio in real time, and a Max/MSP interface that provides MIDI processing functions and real-time adjustments. The AMT model can achieve an onset F1 score of over 95% in ideal conditions, with an approximate latency of 350ms.</p>

            <h3>Performance Preparation</h3>
            <p>The piece was designed with two pianos standing side by side, engaging in an interactive musical dialogue. The human pianist follows a score-driven structure, while the computer-controlled piano "listens" to the performance, analyzing, interpreting, and responding to it in real time. Through approximately 15 rehearsals and multiple system refinements, a balance was achieved between compositional structure and dynamic interactivity.</p>

            <h3>Full Score</h3>
            <p>The composition employs tonal structures and harmonies imbued with a mystical character to reflect the enigmatic dialogue between human and machine. The score contains detailed instructions for both the human pianist and the computer operator.</p>
